## Project Description

Planning group trips often becomes disorganized, with details scattered across multiple chat apps, spreadsheets, and emails. Friends may struggle to agree on dates, destinations, or budgets, and important updates are easily missed. The lack of a centralized system results in duplicated work, miscommunication, and last-minute confusion about itineraries, costs, or responsibilities.
