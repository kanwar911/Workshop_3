# Trip Sharing App

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to create a **Trip Sharing Mobile App** that helps groups plan trips together in a single place. Instead of juggling chats, spreadsheets, and screenshots, users will be able to create or join a trip, invite friends, discuss in real time, propose activities, vote on options, and build a shared itinerary that everyone can see.

## 2. Overview

The Trip Sharing App will provide a centralized, mobile-first experience for collaborative trip planning. Users will manage trips, members, activities, and decisions in one app, with secure authentication and reliable data storage.

### 2.1 Objective

Have a production-ready mobile application that allows a group to (a) sign up / log in, (b) create or join a trip, (c) chat and propose activities, (d) vote to decide, and (e) maintain a shared itinerary—with data persisted securely and available across sessions.

## 3. Milestones

The following milestones correspond directly to the team’s sprint structure on GitHub, representing the logical progression of development phases for the Trip Sharing App:

1. **Sprint 1 — Auth & First Trip**  
   Implement authentication (sign-up, log-in, password reset) and allow users to create or join their first trip.

2. **Sprint 2 — Invitations & Roles**  
   Enable users to invite others to a trip and assign roles (owner, editor, viewer).

3. **Sprint 3 — Itinerary (List & Calendar)**  
   Create functionality to add, edit, and display trip activities in list and calendar formats.

4. **Sprint 4 — Real-time Chat**  
   Develop in-app messaging to support real-time group communication within a trip.

5. **Sprint 5 — Voting System**  
   Add group voting on trip decisions (e.g., destination, date, activities) with visible results.

6. **Sprint 6 — Travel Integration (Skyscanner)**  
   Integrate third-party APIs for flights and accommodations to enrich the planning experience.

7. **Sprint 7 — Media & Notifications**  
   Implement push notifications for updates and allow photo uploads to a shared trip album.

8. **Sprint 8 — CI/CD, Docker & Polish**  
   Finalize development with containerization, CI/CD automation, and general refinements for stability and deployment.
