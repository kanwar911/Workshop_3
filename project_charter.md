# Trip Sharing App

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to create a **Trip Sharing Mobile App** that helps groups plan trips together in a single place. Instead of juggling chats, spreadsheets, and screenshots, users will be able to create or join a trip, invite friends, discuss in real time, propose activities, vote on options, and build a shared itinerary that everyone can see.

## 2. Overview

The Trip Sharing App will provide a centralized, mobile-first experience for collaborative trip planning. Users will manage trips, members, activities, and decisions in one app, with secure authentication and reliable data storage.

### 2.1 Objective

Have a production-ready mobile application that allows a group to (a) sign up / log in, (b) create or join a trip, (c) chat and propose activities, (d) vote to decide, and (e) maintain a shared itinerary—with data persisted securely and available across sessions.

## 3. Milestones

The following milestones correspond directly to the team’s sprint structure on GitHub, representing the logical progression of development phases for the Trip Sharing App:

1. **Sprint 1 — Auth & First Trip**  
   Implement authentication (sign-up, log-in, password reset) and allow users to create or join their first trip.

2. **Sprint 2 — Invitations & Roles**  
   Enable users to invite others to a trip and assign roles (owner, editor, viewer).

3. **Sprint 3 — Itinerary (List & Calendar)**  
   Create functionality to add, edit, and display trip activities in list and calendar formats.

4. **Sprint 4 — Real-time Chat**  
   Develop in-app messaging to support real-time group communication within a trip.

5. **Sprint 5 — Voting System**  
   Add group voting on trip decisions (e.g., destination, date, activities) with visible results.

6. **Sprint 6 — Travel Integration (Skyscanner)**  
   Integrate third-party APIs for flights and accommodations to enrich the planning experience.

7. **Sprint 7 — Media & Notifications**  
   Implement push notifications for updates and allow photo uploads to a shared trip album.

8. **Sprint 8 — CI/CD, Docker & Polish**  
   Finalize development with containerization, CI/CD automation, and general refinements for stability and deployment.

# 4. Deliverables

The Trip Sharing App project will produce several key deliverables that ensure the functionality, usability, and maintainability of the system. Each deliverable represents a major outcome of development, testing, or integration work completed during specific sprints.

| # | Deliverable | Description |
|---|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Authentication Module** | Implements secure user sign-up, login, logout, and password reset functionality using modern authentication standards (e.g., JWT or Firebase Auth). Includes email verification and encrypted credential storage. |
| 2 | **Trip Management Module** | Enables users to create, join, and manage trips. Supports trip ownership roles (owner, editor, viewer), invitation management, and basic trip metadata (title, dates, description). |
| 3 | **Itinerary Module** | Provides functionality to create, edit, and organize trip activities. Displays data both in a chronological list view and calendar view to help groups visualize their plans. |
| 4 | **Collaboration Tools** | Adds real-time chat and group messaging within each trip, allowing participants to discuss plans and updates. Also includes push notifications for activity changes and important updates. |
| 5 | **Voting Feature** | Allows group members to propose and vote on trip decisions such as destination, travel dates, or activities. Displays results transparently to promote consensus-based planning. |
| 6 | **API Integration Layer** | Integrates with third-party travel APIs (e.g., Skyscanner) for flight and accommodation search, and supports media upload functionality for photos and shared trip galleries. |
| 7 | **Automation & Deployment Pipeline** | Includes a Dockerized environment for consistent builds, along with CI/CD workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate testing, deployment, and delivery to hosting platforms. |
| 8 | **Documentation Package** | Provides detailed user documentation, developer setup instructions, and API references. Ensures maintainability and scalability for future iterations of the app. |
| 9 | **Testing Suite** | Includes automated unit, integration, and UI tests to validate app stability, data integrity, and user experience across devices. |
